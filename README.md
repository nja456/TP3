Questions:
1) In your point of view, what was complicated in the TP#2? What where your pain points?
What could you do when expanding this TP to avoid these further?
2) What are the S.O.L.I.D. principles? What are the “KISS rule” and the “boy scout rule”? What’s 
clean code, clean architecture?
3) How would you expand this code? What can you add to the software you build to make it 
more useful, reliable, relevant to the user? Find 5 ways to improve your previous TP, even if 
that’s not doable.

ANSWER
1) It's was medium. i just got comprehension problem. i thought the questions was just indications and not to be answering.
  It just ask my friends 

2) The SOLID Principles are five principles of Object-Oriented class design. They are a set of rules and best practices to follow while designing a class structure.
These five principles help us understand the need for certain design patterns and software architecture in general. So I believe that it is a topic that every developer should learn.
.Single Responsibility Principle
.Open-Closed Principle
.Liskov Substitution Principle
.Interface Segregation Principle
.Dependency Inversion Principle

KISS (Keep it simple, stupid)
KISS rule is a constant reminder to emphasize the simplest way forward
Keep your code simple. One method should do one thing at a time.

the 'boy-scout rule' an another Always leave the code better than you found it.

The most popular definition of clean code is code that is easy to understand and easy to change.

Clean architecture is a software design philosophy that separates the elements of a design into ring levels.
